## Initial Project Request

**Date**: July 26, 2025  
**User**: Matthew Eakin  

**Request**: 
My name is Matthew Eakin. I am an ISTBQ certified Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) who wants to build a stand-alone typescript playwright test automation framework with a playwright MCP server built in. The website I will be testing is XNDEV.COM. 

**Goals**:
- Find bugs on the XNDEV.com website (currently under construction)
- Show development team what needs to be worked on next
- Write tests that demonstrate how functionality should work
- When executed, tests will fail for bugs, pass when bugs are fixed

**Bug Types to Focus On**:
- Broken links (links with no URL listed)
- Bad webpage development practices (multiple H1 tags, strict mode violations, invisible broken links)
- Any functionality that doesn't work as expected

**Requirements**:
- Use Page Object Model for each page
- Create README file "The Tests" with test descriptions, expected results, and status
- Create README file "Bug-Report" to document found bugs
- Create README file "prompts" to track all prompts (this file)
- Test using only Chromium
- Follow guidelines in copilot-instructions-playwright.md
