- Follow the guidelines in `copilot-instructions.md`
- As bugs are found, document them in the `Bug-Report.md` file

## ISTQB Testing Standards Focus

Ensure tests follow ISTQB principles:
- **Test Design Techniques**: Equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis
- **Test Documentation**: Clear test objectives, preconditions, test steps, expected results
- **Defect Management**: Proper bug classification and documentation
- **Test Coverage**: Functional, structural, and risk-based testing approaches

## Testing Focus Areas

Based on the bug-first approach from Prompt 01, look for:
- Broken links and navigation issues
- Multiple H1 elements (HTML standards violation)

- Blog post listings and pagination functionality
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Content organization and categorization
- Archive and date-based navigation
- Comments and interaction features (if present)

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Updated BlogPage.ts** - Page object with all discovered elements
2. **Updated/Created Test File** - Functional tests for the Blog page following ISTQB standards
3. **Updated Test Documentation** - Current test list with new tests
4. **Bug Documentation** - Any bugs found documented in Bug-Report.md with proper classification

## Guidelines Compliance

- Follow copilot-instructions.md guidelines
- Use TypeScript and Playwright
- Test only with Chromium browser
- Implement Page Object Model pattern
- Document bugs for development team action
- Adhere to ISTQB testing methodology and documentation standards
